Directions:

1. Place water in a small saucepan.

2. Sprinkle Jell-O and unflavored gelatin over water and let sit for 5 minutes.

3. Put saucepan on stove over medium heat and heat until the gelatin has combined with the water (takes about 2 minutes).

6. Allow to sit until candy has set, about 20 minutes.

Enjoy!
